# My First CSS Layout Project: Box Model Practice

Welcome to my first CSS project! In this project, I focused on learning how to structure a website using **HTML** and how to style it using **CSS Selectors** and the **Box Model**. 

## What I Practiced:
* **CSS Box Model:** I learned the difference between `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `content`.
* **Selectors:** I used `id`, `class`, and element selectors to apply different styles.
* **Layouting:** I practiced centering elements using `margin: auto` and controlling widths with `max-width`.
* **Colors & Typography:** I chose a "Nature Green" color palette to make the website look clean and professional.

## Project Structure
The project consists of three main sections:
1. **Hobby:** A card about my journey in coding.
2. **Simple-Food:** A card describing one of my favorite foods.
3. **Services:** A card about web design basics.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `2index.html` in any web browser.

## Personal Note:
This is my very first step into web development. I am proud of how I controlled the spacing and layout without using complex frameworks. I'm excited to learn Flexbox and Grid next!
