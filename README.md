# My First HTML Portfolio

## About This Project
This is my first personal HTML portfolio. In this project, I practiced creating a simple, well-structured webpage using semantic HTML tags. I learned how to organize content into sections, use `id` and `class` attributes, and create navigational links.

I also included a personal motivation box, contact information, and links to my GitHub profile. This project helped me understand how to build a professional-looking webpage step by step.
