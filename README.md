# Different types of HTML form inputs Project 📝

Hi! This is a simple project where I practiced how to create and use **HTML Forms**. This is part of my web development learning journey.

## What I Learned 💡
In this lesson, I learned how to build forms to collect user data. I used the following HTML tags:
* `<form>`: To create the form container.
* `<input>`: For text, passwords, and email.
* `<label>`: To give names to form fields.
* `<textarea>`: For long messages.
* `<button>`: To submit the data.

## Project Features ✨
* **Registration Form**: Name, Email, and Password fields.
* **Input Types**: Text, Email, Number, and Date.
* **Buttons**: Submit and Reset buttons.



## How to Run 🚀
1. Download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

## My Progress 📈
- [x] Create basic HTML structure
- [x] Add form inputs
- [x] Add a submit button
- [ ] Add CSS styling (Next step!)
