# HTML Lesson 6 - Multimedia

## About This Project
This project demonstrates how to use multimedia elements in HTML. 
I learned how to add audio, video, and images to a webpage using HTML5 tags. 
I also practiced using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for captions, and `<source>` for providing multiple media formats.
This lesson helped me understand how to structure multimedia content properly and make web pages more interactive and user-friendly.

## Features
- Play audio using the `<audio>` tag with controls and looping.
- Display video using the `<video>` tag with controls, looping, and custom size.
- Add images using the `<img>` tag with alternative text and title.
- Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to add captions for audio, video, and images.
- Include multiple media sources with the `<source>` tag to ensure compatibility.
