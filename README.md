# My HTML Practice Project

## About
This is a small project where I practice **HTML basics**.  
I learned how to use:

- Images and links
- Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)
- Tables with rowspan and colspan

---

## Table Practice
Example of a table I made:

| Subject | Test 1 | Test 2 | Final |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Math    | 80     | 85     | B     |
| Math    | 90     | 88     | A     |
| English | 75     | 82     | B     |

**Notes:**
- Rowspan = when a subject goes over two rows
- Colspan = when a title covers many columns

---

## List Practice
Example of nested lists:

- Frontend
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- Backend
