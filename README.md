# 🌤 CSS Lesson 1 – Selectors and Basic Styling

## 📌 About This Project

This project is my first step into the world of CSS.  
In this lesson, I learned how to style an HTML page using different types of CSS selectors and basic design properties.

The goal of this project was to understand how CSS works with HTML structure and how styles are applied using selectors.

## 🎯 What I Practiced

In this project, I used:

- Universal selector (`*`)
- Element selectors (`body`, `p`, `h1`, etc.)
- Grouping selector (`header, footer`)
- ID selector (`#skills`, `#contactme`)
- Class selector (`.section`, `.skills-image`)
- Descendant selector (`nav ul`, `nav a`)
- Hover effect (`button:hover`)
- Basic layout styling (margin, padding, border-radius)
- Background colors and color harmony
- Text styling and font settings

## 🎨 Design Concept

I chose a **sky-blue color palette** to create a clean and modern look.

- Header and Footer → Dark blue  
- Sections → Light sky blue  
- Background → Soft light tone  

This helped me understand how color contrast and harmony affect visual appearance.

## 🚀 Next Steps

After learning selectors, I will continue with:

- Box model
- Display and positioning
- Layout techniques
- Responsive design

This project marks the beginning of my CSS journey as a future full stack developer.
